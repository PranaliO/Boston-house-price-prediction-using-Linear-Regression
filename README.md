# Boston-house-price-prediction-using-Linear-Regression
 This project uses the Boston Housing dataset to build a Linear Regression model that predicts house prices based on various features such as crime rate, number of rooms, and proximity to employment centers. The trained model is then deployed using Flask as a web application with a styled front-end using HTML and CSS.
